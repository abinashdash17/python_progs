[range]
range(a,b) gets values from a to b-1
use chr(97) to print character whose ascii value is 97.
[specialty of :]
just by adding ":" at the end of line, writing do,then,end etc. can be plainly avoided which is necessary in lua or bash
[dictionary]
to use dictionary use the below functions
1.dict_name[key]=value
2.dict_name[key]
3.dict_name.pop(key)
4.print(dict_name) to print the whole dictionary
[list and tuple]
use str.split(',') to convert str to list delimited by comma.
use tuple(list_name) to convert list to tuple.
use x.append(element) to add element
use x.pop() to delete recent element
to join a list of strings, use
",".join(list_of_str)
LIST COMPREHENSION:
lst = [[ i*j for j in range(0,3)] for i in range(0,40) ]
lst = [ i for i in range(1,5) ]
li.sort() --> sort contents of list alphabetically but does n't return the list. So to keep list intact first copy to a new list then apply sort on new list.
[classes]
use 'pass' to run program without error
__init__(self) for constructor
use self inside methods.
__del__() --> destructor
use clasname.var to access static variable
use self.var to access instance variable
